Testing out hierarchical models in [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev).

The repository contains R-scripts for downloading the data and fitting a a multilevel model with a separate effect for each station, day of the week and also separate rain and temperature effects for each day of the week on [helsinki cyclist count data](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat).
